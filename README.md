## About

This is a Java implementation of the [Edmonds-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.

## Instructions to compile and run

First, compile with the `make` command.

Then you can run `java EdmondsKarp <filename>` where `<filename>` is the name of the input file containing a directed, weighted graph.

For example, `java EdmondsKarp Project3Graph1.txt`.
